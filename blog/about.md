title: About

Hello, I'm Zespre from Taiwan. This is where I share my exploration on
open-source software especially on cloud native things. As a software engineer,
I mainly focus on streamlining the development process, from methodologies to
implementations. Bringing values to customers and colleagues is the core vision
that I believe and trying to fulfill.

I was a sysadmin serving at [CSCC in NCTU](https://it.cs.nycu.edu.tw) (now
being [NYCU](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/en/)) while doing master's degree. My
mission was to maintain a bunch of [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org) servers
and various services running on top of them. What I gained the most is the
experience of defining problem scopes and finding root causes in a short period
of time.

Three years later I started my career at Information and Communications
Research Laboratories, [ITRI](https://www.itri.org.tw). I was dedicated to the
development of a tool for bare-metal server provisioning, called BAMPI. Our
client is one of the most largest teleco in Japan. It was hard but an
interesting experience to deal with the requests from Japanese customer. After
that, we saw there is a need to manage physical resource pool just like the
cloud service providers do. People can request for physical resources in terms
of compute, networking, and storage, in a self-service way. So I designed and
implemented a platform called PROP (Physical Resource Orchestration Platform),
and it turned out to be a product of the company, which was renamed to ITRI
HaaS (Hardware as a Service).

Recently, I'm spending a lot of time playing around with cloud native projects
and figuring out how cloud native technologies can aid bare-metal clouds in the
era of 5G and edge computing.
